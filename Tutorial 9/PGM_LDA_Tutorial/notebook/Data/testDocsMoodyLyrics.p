aS'If the night turned cold\nAnd the stars looked down\nAnd you hug yourself\nOn the cold cold ground\nYou wake the morning\nIn a stranger\'s coat\nNo one would you see\nYou ask yourself, "Who\'d watch for me?"\nMy only friend, who could it be?\nIt\'s hard to say it\nI hate to say it\nBut it\'s probably me\n\nWhen your belly\'s empty\nAnd the hunger\'s so real\nAnd you\'re too proud to beg\nAnd too dumb to steal\nYou search the city\nFor your only friend\nNo one would you see\nYou ask yourself, "Who could it be?"\nA solitary voice to speak out and set me free\nI hate to say it\nI hate to say it\nBut it\'s probably me\n\nYou\'re not the easiest person I ever got to know\nAnd it\'s hard for us both to let our feelings show\nSome would say I should let you go your way\nYou\'ll only make me cry\nIf there\'s one guy, just one guy\nWho\'d lay down his life for you and die\nIt\'s hard to say it\nI hate to say it\nBut it\'s probably me\n\nWhen the world\'s gone crazy, and it makes no sense\nAnd there\'s only one voice that comes to your defense\nAnd the jury\'s out and your eyes search the room\nAnd one friendly face is all you need to see\nIf there\'s one guy, just one guy\nWho\'d lay down his life for you and die\nIt\'s hard to say it\nI hate to say it\nBut it\'s probably me\n\nI hate to say it\nI hate to say it\nBut it\'s probably me\n\nI hate to say it\nI hate to say it\nBut it\'s probably me\n\nI hate to say it\nI hate to say it\nBut it\'s probably me'
